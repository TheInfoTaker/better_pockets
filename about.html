                <h2 class="title_about">Sizing</h2>
                <p class="about_txt">Getting the right-sized pocket is actually easier than you might think. During the checkout process, you will input your pant size, glove size, and whether you want your pocket to be snug, standard, or spacious. With this information, we will be able to determine which size pocket will be perfect for you.</p>

                <h2 class="title_about" >Fabric</h2>
                <p class="about_txt">At Better Pockets, we offer multiple types of fabric to ensure that your pockets are exactly to your liking. In addition to fabric types, we offer different fabric patterns because we want you to be happy with your pockets inside and out. We offer options such as satin, cotton, denim, and nylon.</p>

                <h2 class="title_about">The Process</h2>
                <p class="about_txt">First, we remove the old pocket by carefully unpicking the stitching that holds the old pocket in place. Next, we cut a new pocket using soft fabric in a size that fits your needs. Finnaly, we use a heavy-duty needle and a strong thread to sew the pocket in place. </p>

                <h2 class="title_about">Purchasing Multiple Pairs</h2>
                <p class="about_txt">You may be surprised to learn that the biggest cost associated with your purchase will not be the replacement service, but the shipping costs. Because of this, we recommend that rather than sending in a single pair of pants, send in multiple pairs that need adjusting and ship them together so that you can save on shipping costs.</p>

            <div class="panel">
              <p>
                1.	Measure your dominant hand. Your dominant hand is typically larger than your non-dominant hand, so it's important to measure the correct one.
                2.	Measure the widest part of your hand. This is usually just below your knuckles, but it can vary depending on the shape of your hand.
                3.	Measure the length of your hand. Measure from the tip of your middle finger to the base of your palm.
                4.	Use a sizing chart to determine your glove size. Glove sizes are typically measured in inches, so use your measurements to find the size that matches.</p>
