      <h3>Main</h3>
      <p>
        For some reason, pant manufacturers think that women only need to fit a couple of pennies in their pockets or believe that we don’t need them at all. It’s hard enough to find a pair of pants that fit let alone having to worry about the pockets. If you find a good-fitting pair of pants, replacing the terrible pockets on your own is difficult and not worth the trouble, but you don’t have to worry about that because we will do it for you!
      </p>
      <h3>How The Service Works</h3>
      <p>
        There are two different options when purchasing our pocket replacement service. Before you make a purchase you will be asked whether you would like to purchase a new pair of pants, or use an existing pair. If you are purchasing a new pair, rather than inputting your own address in checkout, input our address. If you would have the pockets of a pair of pants that you currently own swapped, first make sure that they are washed and clean, then have them shipped to our address. When we receive the item we will replace the pockets according to your specifications and then send them directly back to you.

        <h3>Sizing</h3>
        <p>
        Getting the right-sized pocket is actually easier than you might think. During the checkout process, you will input your pant size, glove size, and whether you want your pocket to be snug, standard, or spacious. With this information, we will be able to determine which size pocket will be perfect for you.
      </p>
      <h3>Fabric</h3>
      <p>
        At Better Pockets, we offer multiple types of fabric to ensure that your pockets are exactly to your liking. In addition to fabric types, we offer different fabric patterns because we want you to be happy with your pockets inside and out. We offer options such as satin, cotton, denim, and nylon.
      </p>
      <h3>The Process</h3>
      <p>
        First, we remove the old pocket by carefully unpicking the stitching that holds the old pocket in place. Next, we cut a new pocket using soft fabric in a size that fits your needs. Finnaly, we use a heavy-duty needle and a strong thread to sew the pocket in place. 
      </p>
      <h3>Purchasing Multiple Pairs</h3>
      <p>
        You may be surprised to learn that the biggest cost associated with your purchase will not be the replacement service, but the shipping costs. Because of this, we recommend that rather than sending in a single pair of pants, send in multiple pairs that need adjusting and ship them together so that you can save on shipping costs.

      <h2>Common Questions</h2>
      <br>
      <h3>How do I figure out my glove size?</h3>
      <p>
      	1.	Measure your dominant hand. Your dominant hand is typically larger than your non-dominant hand, so it's important to measure the correct one. 
      	2.	Measure the widest part of your hand. This is usually just below your knuckles, but it can vary depending on the shape of your hand. 
      	3.	Measure the length of your hand. Measure from the tip of your middle finger to the base of your palm. 
      	4.	Use a sizing chart to determine your glove size. Glove sizes are typically measured in inches, so use your measurements to find the size that matches.
      </p>
