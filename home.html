            <p id="main_txt">For some reason, pant manufacturers think that women only need to fit a couple of pennies in their pockets or believe that we don’t need them at all. It’s hard enough to find a pair of pants that fit let alone having to worry about the pockets. If you find a good-fitting pair of pants, replacing the terrible pockets on your own is difficult and not worth the trouble, but you don’t have to worry about that because we will do it for you!</p>

            <p class="ad_txt">There are two different options when purchasing our pocket replacement service. Before you make a purchase you will be asked whether you would like to purchase a new pair of pants, or use an existing pair. If you are purchasing a new pair, rather than inputting your own address in checkout, input our address. If you would have the pockets of a pair of pants that you currently own swapped, first make sure that they are washed and clean, then have them shipped to our address. When we receive the item we will replace the pockets according to your specifications and then send them directly back to you.</p>
